Description
  AutomaDeD (Automata-based Debugging for Dissimilar parallel tasks) is a
  tool for automatic diagnosis of performance and correctness problems in
  MPI applications. It creates control-flow models of each MPI process
  and, when a failure occurs, these models are leveraged to find the
  origin of problems automatically. MPI calls are intercepted (using
  wrappers) to create the models. When an MPI application hangs, AutomaDeD
  creates a progress-dependence graph that helps finding the process (or
  group of processes) that caused the hang.
